The village of Honeywood has been terrorized by strange, deadly creatures for months now. Unable to endure any 
longer, the villagers pooled their wealth and hired the most skilled adventurer they could find: you. After
listening to their tale of woe, you agree to enter the labyrinth where most of the creatures seem to originate,
and destroy the foul beasts. Armed with a longsword and a bundle of torches, you descend into the labyrinth, 
ready to do battle....
